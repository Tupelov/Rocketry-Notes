# Description
Pressure-fed engines rely on the pressure from their propellant tanks to pump the propellant into the combustion chamber. They usually carry a separate tank of high pressure inert gas, such as helium, in order to maintain pressure. These engines are rudimentary and are inefficient; the lack of a turbopump makes their design much simpler though.
