# Description
Impulse is the change of [[Momentum]]. The *total impulse* can be found by integrating [[Force]] with respect to time.
$${I_t=\int_0^tF\, dt}$$
Total impulse $I_t$ is essentially proportional to the total energy released by a propulsion system.

There are various symbols for impulse:
- Impulse: $I$
- Total Impulse: $I_t$
- [[Specific Impulse]]: $I_s$ or $I_{sp}$
