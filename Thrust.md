# Description
Thrust is the [[force]] produced by the propulsion system acting on the vehicle's center of mass. It is a [[Newtons Law's of Motion#Law 3|reaction force]] experienced by a vehicles structure from the ejection of propellant at high velocities.

## Momentum Thrust
Thrust due to a change in [[momentum]], is shown below. Here, the exit gas velocity $v$, is assumed constant and if the [[mass flow rate]] is constant then oftentimes the thrust is also constant. This idealized thrust is often close to the real thrust.
$$F=\frac{d(mv)}{dt}=\dot{m}v$$
