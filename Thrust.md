# Description
Thrust is the [[force]] produced by the propulsion system acting on the vehicle's center of mass. It is a [[Newtons Law's of Motion#Law 3|reaction force]] experienced by a vehicles structure from the ejection of propellant at high velocities.

## Momentum Thrust
Thrust due to a change in [[momentum]], is shown below. Here, the exit gas velocity $v$, is assumed constant and if the [[mass flow rate]] is constant then oftentimes the thrust is also constant. This idealized thrust is often close to the real thrust.
$$F=\frac{d(mv)}{dt}=\dot{m}v$$
## Pressure Thrust

The pressure of the remaining propellant gives rise to the second part of thrust. The pressure of the propellant creates a force upon exiting $p_e$, due to an imbalance in pressure. Knowing that pressure is force applied per area ($\frac{kg}{m^2}$) we can multiply it by the area $A$ to get the pressure thrust. Because the force comes from a *drop* in pressure, we must subtract $p_a$, the ambient pressure:
$$F=\dot{m}v+(p_e-p_a)A$$
Pressure thrust is generated from the difference in pressure between the exit of the nozzle and ambient pressure. This means that if the ambient pressure is higher than the exit pressure, there is a *negative* pressure thrust. Typically rocket nozzles use an exit pressure at or slightly above ambient pressure.
