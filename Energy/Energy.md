# Description
In rocket's, 2 types of energy conversion is done. The production of energy and it's conversion to reaction thrust. The source of energy depends on the type of propulsion system.
## Jet Power
The kinetic energy of ejected propellant is the main useful form of energy for propulsion. The jet power is the derivative of this energy. $$P{jet}=\frac{d(\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2)}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v_e^2=\frac{1}{2}Fv_e$$
## Specific Power
Specific Power is used to measure the utility of the mass of the propulsion system, including it's power source. It is jet power divided by the loaded propulsion system mass.
$$P_s=\frac{P_{jet}}{m_0}$$
## Chemical Power
*Chemical Power* is the maximum energy available to a chemical rocket, it is their heat of combustion per unit of propellant mass $Q_R$:
$$P_{chem}=\dot{m}Q_RJ$$
The units for $Q_r$ is $\frac{J}{kg}$ or heat of reaction per unit propellant. $J$ is a conversion constant and isn't necessary in metric.
