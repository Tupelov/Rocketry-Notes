# Description
High energy efficiency can be desriable but at times minimizing expended propellant is more imporant. With nuclear energy, heat availibility is practically unlimited but there is a finite amount of propellant. For a set thrust, high efffective exhaust velocities result in more efficient propellant use. Thus, because specific impulse is proportional to the exhaust velocity, it can be used to measure the propellant mass economy.

### Combustion Effciency
The combustion efficiency $\eta_{comb}$  for chemical rockets is the ratio of the actual energy released to the [[Power#Chemical Power|chemical power]] and represents a measure of energy source efficiency. If multiplied by the chemical power, we get the actual power available to the rocket.
## Internal Efficiency
The internal efficiency $\eta_{int}$  is how well a propulsion device can convert its available energy into kinetic energy.
$$\eta_{int} =\frac{P_{jet}}{{P_{available}}}$$
## Propulsive Efficiency
Whenever a rocket travels through a fluid, it disturbs it in way that might affect its motion, resulting in extra energy being used. The propulsive efficiency reflects this and shows how much of the rockets kinetic energy is useful for prepelling it. With $P_{res}$ being the residual kinetic power.
$$\eta_p=\frac{P_{jet}}{P_{jet}+P_{res}}=\frac{Fu}{Fu+\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}(c-u)^2}=\frac{2u/c}{1+(u/c)^2}$$
  Where $P_{res}$ is the residual kinetic energy, *F* is the thrust, *u* is the abolute vehicle veloctiy and *c* is the [[effective exhaust velocity]] of the propellant with respect to the vehicle. This propulsive efficiency becomes one when the forward velocity of the rocket is exactly equal to the effective exhaust elocity; here there is 0 residual kinetic energy and the gasses effectively stand still in space.
