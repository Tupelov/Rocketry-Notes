#Analysis 
# Description
*The propellant mass fraction* $\zeta$, indicates the ratio of useful propellant mass $m_p$ to the initial mass $m_0$. Like [[mass ratio]] it can be used to describe a rocket propulsion system, a stage or a whole vehicle with it's values varying depending on what is analyzed.
$$\zeta=\frac{m_p}{m_0}$$
$$\zeta=\frac{m_0-m_f}{m_0}$$
If used to describe a propulsion system, the initial mass $m_0$ consists of the hardware used to store and burn the propellant and the effective propellant mass. The final mass $m_f$ includes the propulsion system, tanks, and the residual propellant. When applied to a whole propulsion system, $\zeta$  indicates the quality of a design. For example $\zeta=0.95$ means that only 5% of the mass is dedicated to the hardware. High values of $\zeta$ are desirable.
