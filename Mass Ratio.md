#Analysis
# Description
*The mass ratio* $\textbf{MR}$ of a vehicle, stage or propulsion system is the final mass $m_f$ divided by the mass before operation $m_0$. It is an important metric when analyzing flight performance. It is important to specify what the $\textbf{MR}$ applies to. (Vehicle, Stage, Propulsion System etc.)
$$\textbf{MR}=\frac{m_f}{m_0}$$
