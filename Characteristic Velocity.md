# Description
Characteristic velocity $c^*$, is a method of determining rocket engine efficiency and can be readily determined by measurements of $\dot{m}$, $p_c$, and $A_t$. Being essentially independent of nozzle characteristics it is used for measuring combustion efficiency, this is in contrast to [[specific impulse]] and [[effective exhaust velocity]].
$$c^*=\frac{p_cA_t}{\dot{m}}$$
