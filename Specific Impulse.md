# Description
Specific Impulse is a method of measuring rocket engine efficiency. It can be thought of as the thrust per the weight of propellant. By dividing [[Impulse]] by $\dot{m}$ ([[Mass Flow Rate]]) and a universal gravitational constant $g_0$, one can determine and compare rocket engine efficiency regardless of nozzle characteristics and units used. 
$$I_s=\frac{\int_0^tF\,dt}{g_0\int_0^t\dot{m}\,dt}$$The purpose of $g_0$ is to make calculated impulse the same regardless of the unit system used.(Without it we get [[effective exhaust velocity]]) Below, the units inside the equation are laid out, the integrals are already integrated here.
$$I_s=\frac{kg\;\frac{m}{s}}{\frac{m}{s^2}\;kg}=s$$
Weight flow rate $\dot{w}$, usually is used to describe mass flow rate $\dot{m}$, multiplied by the gravitational constant $g_0$.
$$\dot{w}=\dot{m}g_0$$
The term *specific propellant consumption* refers to the reciprocal of $I_s$ although it is not typically used in rocketry.
