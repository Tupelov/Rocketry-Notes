# Description
Specific Impulse is a method of measuring rocket engine efficiency. By dividing [[Impulse]] by $\dot{m}$ ([[Mass Flow Rate]]) and a universal gravitational constant, one can determine and compare rocket engine efficiency regardless of nozzle characteristics and units used. 
$$I_s=\frac{\int_0^tF\,dt}{g_0\int_0^t\dot{m}\,dt}$$
