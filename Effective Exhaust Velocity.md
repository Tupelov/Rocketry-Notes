# Description
*Effective Exhaust Velocity* $c$, is a method of measuring rocket efficiency similar to [[specific impulse]]. It is basically the same as $I_s$ but no gravitational constant is applied. Because of this it is tied to the unit system used. It is typically used by the Russians.
$$c=I_sg_0$$
