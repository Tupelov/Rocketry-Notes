#ClassicalMechanics 
Newton's laws of motions are three basic laws of Classical Mechanics that describe the relationhsip between the motion of an object and the [[Force||forces]] acting on it. It is ***fundemental*** to understanding physics.


### Law 1
_Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by [[Force|forces]] impressed upon it._
### Law 2
_The change of [[Momentum]] of an object is proportional to the [[Force]] applied; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the [[Force]] is applied_
### Law 3
_To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction_
