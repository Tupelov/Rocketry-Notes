# Description
A force is any action that causes an object to accelerate. Force is the product of mass and acceleration. [[Newtons Law's of Motion#Law 2|Newton's Second Law]] states that it is the derivative of the [[Momentum]] of an object.
$$F=\frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
The quantity $mv$ is the [[Momentum]], if the mass is constant we can turn the equation into $F=m\frac{dv}{dt}$ and since [[Acceleration]] is defined as $a=\frac{dv}{dt}$ we can rewrite this equation into a more familiar form:
$$F=ma$$
