*The thrust to weight ratio* is the [[thrust]] divided by the weight of a vehicle. It is [[acceleration]] in multiples of $g_0$. As the mass of the rocket decreases the thrust to weight ratio meaning that it is at it's highest just before engine cutoff. It's used as a useful metric for comparing rockets.
$$\textbf{TWR}=\frac{F}{g_0}$$
